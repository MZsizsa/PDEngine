# For developers


- We are using git-flow. You issue pull requests to the develop branch.

- We are doing TDD. You will have tests. Enough in quality and quantity.

- We use kanban. The table is here: https://huboard.com/edemo/PDEngine/

- We meet weekly IRL and/or in hangouts:
 https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/4wsasnqbvfeuvb4bxuhxxppn3ub
 Thursdays 1700 CET, Budapest Al√≠z u.2 1st floor, Silver meeting room

- You can pick any issues not yet assigned. Those we alredy understand are in "Ready".

- If you don't understand an issue, ask in comment and tag @magwas.

The issues we plan to do in the actual week are moved to "in this sprint", and ordered according to priority.

The ones we are working on are in "Working". Those should have the one working with it assigned.

If you are ready with the issue, move it to "Review". Issue the pull request to edemo/develop. You can ask for a reviewer.
Have the issue # in the merge title/a commit title, so merging will move the issue to done.

In the sprint demo we

 - look at each issue in done and review, and archive those which are okay in the test system.

 - move around other issues randomly :)
